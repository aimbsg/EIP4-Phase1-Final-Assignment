Models experimented :
1. Hand written Sequential-Convolution model - Gave complete control of what is happening in each layer but could not beat the final
   accuracy when compared to other architectures
2. ResNet50 (no pre-trained weights)
3. InceptionResNetV2 (no pre-trained weights)

Activation functions experimented :
1. ReLU
2. Sigmoid
3. Swish
4. Softmax

Optimizers experimented :
1. SGD
2. Adam
3. Adadelta

Image augmentation strategies experimented :
1. Horizontal flip
2. Vertical flip
3. Feature wise center and standard normalization
4. Image normalization
5. Shear range, zoom range and brightness range
